# Arrays and Strings

## Arrays

Array Operations

1. Insertion (front and back both)
2. Deletion (front and back both)
3. Searching
4. Searching, insertion, deletion in sorted arrays

## Searching

Algorithms with time complexity

1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search

## Sorting

Algorithms with time complexity

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort

## Some most important techniques to solve and think

1. Two pointers 
   - One slow-runner and the other fast-runner. A classic example is to remove duplicates from a sorted array
2. Prefix sum
   - Quickly find the sum of any subarray using just two array lookups.
     Helps in reducing the time complexity of summing over subarrays from O(n) to O(1).
3. Sliding window
   - The main idea behind the sliding window technique is to convert two nested loops into a single loop. Usually, the technique helps us to reduce the time complexity from O(n²) or O(n³) to O(n).
   - Sliding windows are useful when you need to process adjacent pairs of elements in an ordered data structure, allowing you to easily access and operate on neighboring elements.
   - When you want to find a specific target value or combination of values in an array, a sliding window can help by adjusting the window size and efficiently searching for the desired value or subarrays that meet specific criteria.
   - Sliding windows are handy when you need to find the longest, shortest, or most optimal sequence that satisfies a given condition in a collection. By sliding a window through the collection and tracking relevant information within it, you can identify the desired sequence more efficiently than scanning the entire collection.
4. Subarray and Subsequence
    - Probably will be covered in Strings
